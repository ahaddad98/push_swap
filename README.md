# push_swap
sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions

## Concept of this Project ##

 The idea is simple, You have two stacks called Stack A and Stack B. <br>
 Stack A is given a random list of unorganized numbers.  <br>
 You must take the random list of numbers in Stack A and sort them so that Stack A is organized from smallest to largest. <br> 
 There are only a few moves you’re allowed to used to manipulate the stacks that we’re going to call “Actions”.  <br>
 The main goal of this project is to organize Stack A in as few actions as possible. <br>

 ## MOVES ##

the moves are named:  sa, sb, ss, ra, rb, rr, rra, rrb, rrr, pa, pb.<br>
I use Double linked list to implement these moves :<br>

## sa || sb :arrows_clockwise:  ##
    -swap 2 first element

##  :arrow_heading_up: ra || rb :arrow_right_hook:	 ##
    -put the first element last,and all elemnt go UP by one

##  :arrow_heading_down: rra || rrb :arrows_counterclockwise: ##
    -put the last element First, so all elements go DOWN by ine element

## pa || pb :arrow_right: ##
    -take the first element at the top of a stack and put it at the top of other_stack.

## Checker:
    -Thanks to the checker program, you will be able to check if the
    list of instructions you’ll generate with the program push_swap is
    actually sorting the stack properly.

## This is how much instriction the algorithm Do with 100 random number
